<p>I am an Assistant Professor of Mathematical Finance in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto. I currently serve as the interim academic director for the <a href="https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/MFI"> MFI Master of Financial Insurance (MFI) Program</a>. Additionally, I am an Associate Editor for <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/automatica"> Automatica</a> and the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/imamci"> IMA Journal of Mathematical Control and Information</a>. My research interests include theoretical developments of mean field games and stochastic control, and their applications in financial markets. In particular, I am interested in modeling energy and financial markets as large-population dynamic games and addressing problems such as optimal trading, systemic risk, equilibrium pricing, venture investments and contract design. </p> 

<p>Previously, from 2020 to 2025, I was an Assistant Professor of Financial Engineering in the Department of Decision Sciences at HEC Montréal (business school of University of Montreal), where I was granted tenure. I served as the academic director of the <a href="https://www.hec.ca/en/programs/masters/master-financial-engineering/"> MSc program in financial engineering</a> at HEC, between 2021-2025. </p> 
  
<p>Before joining HEC Montréal, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto, Canada, between 2018-2020, where I worked with <a href="http://sebastian.statistics.utoronto.ca/"> Sebastian Jaimungal</a> in the mathematical finance program. I was also a PhD exchange student in the same program during Fall 2017.  I completed my PhD in electrical engineering under the supervision of <a href="http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~peterc/"> Peter E. Caines</a> in the systems & control program at McGill University, Canada, in 2019. I received my MSc degree from Sharif University of Technology, Iran, in 2011, and my BSc degree from Shiraz University, Iran, in 2009, both in electrical engineering- systems & control.</p>
