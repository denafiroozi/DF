I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Decision Sciences at HEC Montréal (business school of University of Montreal). Before joining HEC Montréal, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Statistical Sciences at the University of Toronto, Canada, between 2018-2020, where I worked with [Prof. Sebastian Jaimungal](http://sebastian.statistics.utoronto.ca/) in the mathematical finance program. I was also a PhD exchange student in the same program during Fall 2017.  I completed my Ph.D. in electrical engineering under the supervision of [Prof. Peter E. Caines](http://www.cim.mcgill.ca/~peterc/) in the systems & control program at McGill University, Canada, in 2019. I received my M.Sc. degree from Sharif University of Technology, Iran, in 2011, and my B.Sc. degree from Shiraz University, Iran, in 2009, both in electrical engineering- systems & control.

My research interests are mathematical finance, mean field games, stochastic control, and estimation theory.
